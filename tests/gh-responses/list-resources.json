Set this to `true` to allow us to observe StoreKit 1 transactions you make with your app outside of Superwall. When this is enabled Superwall will not finish your external transactions. StoreKit 2 will be widely supported in the next major version of our SDK.\r\n- Adds Apple Search Ads attribution data to user attributes, which is visible on the user's page in Superwall. Attribution data will be collected if you have enabled Basic or Advanced Apple Search Ads in the Superwall dashboard settings. Advanced attribution data includes the keyword name, campaign name, bid amount, match type, and more. Otherwise, the basic attribution data will be collected, which is mostly IDs. This data will soon be added to Charts.\r\n- Adds `isSubscribed` to product attributes so that you can use `products.primary.isSubscribed` as a dynamic value in the paywall editor.\r\n- Adds `device.appVersionPadded` to the device properties that you can use in audience filters.\r\n- Adds a `notificationPermissionsDenied` `PaywallOption`, which you can set to show an alert after a user denies notification permissions.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixes issue where network requests that returned an error code weren't being retried.\r\n- Fixes date formatting on a device property."

You can use this as a standalone paywall view that you can embed and present however you like instead of using `register`. This uses `getPaywall(forEvent:params:paywallOverrides:)` under the hood. Note that you're responsible for the deallocation of the view. If you have a `PaywallView` presented somewhere and you try to present the same `PaywallView` elsewhere, you will get a crash.\r\n- Adds our `Superscript` package as a dependency. We are migrating towards using Google's Common Expression Language (CEL) in audience filters to allow for more complex expressions. The use of this is behind a feature flag.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- visionOS fixes."

Then it tries to refresh it in the background. This behavior is behind a feature flag.\r\n- When the Superwall configuration is set or refreshed, a `config_refresh` event is tracked, which will give insight into whether a cached version of the Superwall configuration is being used or not.\r\n- When the Superwall configuration fails to be retrieved, a `config_fail` event is tracked.\r\n- Adds the `config_caching` capability.\r\n- Adds the `SuperwallOption` `collectAdServicesAttribution`. When set to `true`, this will get the app-download campaign attributes associated with Apple Search Ads and attach them to the user attributes. This happens once per user per install. Calling `Superwall.shared.reset()` will fetch the attributes again and attach them to the new user.\r\n- Adds`adServicesAttributionRequest_start`, `adServicesAttributionRequest_fail`, and `adServicesAttributionRequest_complete` events for the lifecycle of collecting AdServices attributes.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Adds in missing `weak self` references inside task group closures."

This means the paywalls will be kept updated even if the app has been open for a long time in the background.\r\n- Adds `build_id` and `cache_key` to `PaywallInfo`.\r\n- Tracks a `config_refresh` Superwall event when the configuration is refreshed.\r\n- Adds product retrying if we fail to fetch an `SKProduct`. This tracks a `paywallProductsLoad_retry` event whenever the product loading request gets retried.\r\n- SW-2899: Adds `Superwall.shared.localeIdentifier` as a convenience variable that you can use to dynamically update the locale used for evaluating rules and getting localized paywalls.\r\n- Adds feature flag to enable text interaction with a paywall.\r\n- SW-2901: Adds `abandoned_product_id` to a `transaction_abandon` event to use in audience filters. You can use this to show a paywall if a user abandons the transaction for a specific product.\r\n- Updates RevenueCat example app to use v5 of their SDK.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixes error message `undefined is not an object` that sometimes appeared when opening a paywall.\r\n- SW-2871: Makes sure to track device attributes after geo location data is found.\r\n- Fixes issue where restored transactions were being finished even if a `PurchaseController` was supplied in configure.\r\n- SW-2879: Adds `capabilities` to device attributes. This is a comma-separated list of capabilities the SDK has that you can target in audience filters. This release adds the `paywall_event_receiver` capability. This indicates that the paywall can receive transaction and restore events from the SDK.\r\n- SW-2879: Adds `configCapabilties` which contains a `name` of the capability and any additional info. The `paywall_event_receiver` capability contains a list of eventNames specifying the exact events paywalljs can receive.\r\n- Fixes a crash caused by an arithmetic overflow if there was an issue with audience filter limits.\r\n- Fixes `UIScreen unavailable in visionOS` error message in `PaywallViewController`."

For example, if a locale is `en_GB`, the `regionCode` will be `GB`. You can use this in the filters of your campaign.\r\n- Adds ability to specify custom API endpoints using `SuperwallOptions` to facilitate local testing more easily.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Calls the completion block even if Superwall.configure is called more than once.\r\n- `getPresentationResult` now confirms assignments for holdouts."
